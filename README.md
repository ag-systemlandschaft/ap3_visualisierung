# Project systemlandschaft
This project visualizes data exchanges between systems, using a model based on the data/data.json file. To deploy, simply copy the files from the assets and data folders, along with the index.html file.

## Configuration Options
### data/data.json
The data/data.json file is where you can add or update filters, systems, and data exchanges. This is the central file for defining the structure and connections of your systems.

### index.html
The index.html file allows you to update header links and footer information. Any changes to the overall page layout or static text content can be made here.

### assets/infoText.js
In the assets/infoText.js file, you can set the default informational text by modifying the setDefaultInfoText function.

### assets/constants.js
The assets/constants.js file contains configuration options for the visualization. You can change settings such as the minimum distance between nodes and the radius of the nodes to better suit your data or design preferences.

### assets/index.css
Finally, the assets/index.css file contains predefined variables for visual styling at the top of the file. These variables, such as colors, font families, and the opacity of unselected elements, are already defined but can be modified to customize the design as needed.
